# Bronx Housing Predictions

In an earlier project, I used a variety of techniques to identify which neighborhoods in New York City's borough of the Bronx were gentrified. Using the predictions gained with the unsupervised machine learning algorithm I devised, I will now look to validate my findings. In this attempt, I will see if the areas I've identified as gentrified could be predicted to have the highest change in housing growth


# Overview
This time series project will try and predict the housing prices for the zip codes in the Bronx that have been identified as gentrified.
